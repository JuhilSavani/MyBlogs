## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher): Required to run the server and client applications.
- **npm** (v6.x or higher) or **yarn** (v1.x or higher): Package managers to install dependencies.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for storing user information. Ensure you have it installed and set up locally or have access to a remote PostgreSQL instance.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/JuhilSavani/MyBlogs
  cd MyBlogs
  ```

2. **Install the dependencies**
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. **Database Setup**<br/>
This project uses PostgreSQL as its database management system. Follow the steps below to set up the database.
    - Open the terminal on your system.
    - Run the following Command to create a database
      ```bash
      psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE my_blogs_db;"
      ```
    - If you encounter a command not found error for psql, you may need to add PostgreSQL to your systemâ€™s PATH environment variable.

4. **Configure a `.env` file**
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project 
- Add the database connection string according to following format
  ```bash
  DB_URL="postgres://username:password@hostname:port/databasename
  ```
  For example, 
  ```bash
  DB_URL="postgres://postgres:password123@localhost:5432/my_blogs_db"
  ```

5. **Running the Application**

Use the following command to start both servers concurrently:
 ```bash
npm start
```
This command will automatically run both the backend and frontend servers for you.
